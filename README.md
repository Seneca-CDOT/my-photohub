# My Photohub

## Introduction

**My Photohub** is a web app that makes it easy to share your photos on the web. **My Photohub** takes your images and optimizes them for the web, creates a beautiful HTML page to show them, and hosts everything in a new [GitHub Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories) owned by you! Your photo web page is made available to the world via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Best of all, everything is free and **you** are in control of the end product.

## Overview

There's never been a time where people had to cope with more images. At the same time, most companies take advantage of our desire to share what we create, charging for storage.

**My Photohub** is designed to leverage the open web and make it easy for anyone to take a bunch of photos and turn them into a web page they can share with the world. You don't need to be a programmer to take advantage of the web or GitHub in order to share your photos.

## How it Works

A **My Photohub** user starts by picking the images they want to share. Imagine you've just gone for a hike, and want to share a page with your favourite images from the day. A new [GitHub Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories) is created on your behalf, and the images are uploaded. Next, the images are automatically optimized for the web and a new HTML web page is created using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). Once the images and page are ready, they are stored in the new [GitHub Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories), and the user is given a URL to their website.

## Requirements

**My Photohub** doesn't store any information and isn't a cloud service in the same way that Google Photos or iCloud are. Instead, **My Photohub** uses [GitHub Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to generate, store, and share photos.

All **My Photohub** users _must have a [GitHub Account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)_ to use the service.
